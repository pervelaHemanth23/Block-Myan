# BLOK MYAN

This game is based on mario.

### Features of this game:-

* As of now, i just built the skeleton of this game to test out its mechanics. 
* It has a simple UI. No HUD as of now.
* There is only 1 level which tests the basic mechanics of the game.
* The level restarts if you die
* There are 2 enemies in the level which keep moving from point A to point B. More info on how i implemented it is in my Enemies repository.

### Mechanics I implemented:-

1. You can move around using the left and right arrows on the keyboard
2. You can jump using the space bar
3. I have implemented a system where your jump height is based on the time you press the Spacebar. There is a max height to which you can reach which can be achieved only by HOLDING DOWN the spacebar.
4. You can jump only 1 block if you tap the spacebar which can help you move precisely whereas holding down the spacebar lets you jump 2 blocks thus helping you to clear big gaps
5. I have implemented *Coyote time* and *Jump Buffering*.
6. I have added enemies with basic A.I. that lets them patrol in a specific path from A to B
7. I have added camera using Cinemachine that follows the player around and helps him see what is ahead
8. I have tried to be as clean as possible in writing my code so that everything is crystal clear.

### What i learnt from this project:-


*Download and extract the Blok Myan.zip file to access the game.*
*Open the Blok Myan.exe to run the game*

### Screenshots


This is a relatively new project in which i am attempting to learn the Physics of unity and various concepts that will help me in the future
